# ml-100days-training
Machine Learning training projects based on Learning ML in 100 Days website, and other sources (see README)

Most of these are Python jupyter notebooks I created, but based heavily on the notebooks and examples
created by Avik Jain as part of his 100 Days of ML Leaning series. This content can be found at:

Additionally, this repo includes the python jupyter notebooks and supporting material for the excellent book by 
Jake VanderPlas called Python Data Science Handbook. This content was copied directly from Jake's github repo
at:

Lastly, this repo also contains python jupiter notebooks and supporting materials from David Taylor's github repo
for machine learning. This content can be found at:
